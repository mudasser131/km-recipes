    ## Ingredients

    - 1/2 teaspoon salt
    - 2-4 tablespoons water (if needed)
    <br>
    ## Instructions
    
    1. **Make the Noodle Dough:**
       - In a large mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour and make a well in the center.
       - Add eggs and salt into the well.
       - Gradually mix the eggs and flour until the dough starts coming together. Add water if needed to form a cohesive ball.
    
    2. **Knead the Dough:**
       - Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
    
    3. **Rest the Dough:**
       - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
    
    4. **Roll Out the Dough:**
       - Divide the dough into two portions.
       - Roll out one portion on a floured surface into a thin sheet, about 1/8 inch (3mm) thick.
    
    5. **Cut the Noodles:**
       - Fold the dough a few times to create layers, then cut it into your desired noodle width.
    
    6. **Cook the Noodles:**
       - Boil a large pot of salted water.
       - Add the freshly cut noodles and stir to prevent sticking.
       - Cook for 2-4 minutes until tender but slightly firm (al dente).
    
    7. **Drain and Serve:**
       - Drain the noodles using a colander.
       - Serve with your favorite sauce or toppings.

    ## Notes
    
    - Customize your noodles by adjusting the thickness and width to your liking.
    - Fresh noodles cook quickly, so be attentive to avoid overcooking.
    
    Enjoy your homemade noodles!
