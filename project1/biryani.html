    Certainly, here's a step-by-step recipe for making a classic Chicken Biryani. Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful Indian rice dish that combines rice, meat, and aromatic spices. 
<br>
    **Ingredients:**
    
    For Marinating the Chicken:
    - 500 grams (about 1 pound) chicken, cut into pieces
    - 1 cup yogurt
    - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
    - 1 teaspoon red chili powder
    - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
    - 1 teaspoon garam masala
    - Salt to taste
    - 2 tablespoons cooking oil
    <br>
    For the Rice:
    - 2 cups basmati rice
    - 4 cups water
    - 2-3 green cardamom pods
    - 2-3 cloves
    - 1 bay leaf
    - Salt to taste
    <br>
    For Assembling the Biryani:
    - 2 large onions, thinly sliced
    - 1/4 cup cooking oil or ghee
    - 1/2 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves
    - 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
    <br>
    **Instructions:**
    
    **Marinating the Chicken:**
    
    1. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, and 2 tablespoons of oil.
    
    2. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them thoroughly. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate it for a few hours for better flavor.
    
    **Preparing the Rice:**
    
    1. Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes.
    
    2. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice, green cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaf, and salt.
    
    3. Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (al dente). Drain the rice and set it aside.
    
    **Frying the Onions:**
    
    1. Heat the cooking oil or ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pan.
    
    2. Add the sliced onions and fry them over medium heat until they become golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions for garnish.
    
    **Assembling and Cooking the Biryani:**
    
    1. In the same pan, where you fried the onions, layer half of the partially cooked rice.
    
    2. Spread the marinated chicken evenly over the rice.
    
    3. Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves over the chicken.
    
    4. Layer the remaining rice over the chicken.
    
    5. Top with the remaining fried onions, coriander, and mint leaves.
    
    6. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil to trap the steam.
    
    7. Cook on low heat for about 30-40 minutes, allowing the biryani to steam and the chicken to cook through.
    
    8. Check for doneness by testing a piece of chicken for tenderness and ensuring the rice is fully cooked.
    
    9. Once done, fluff the biryani gently with a fork, combining the layers.

    Serve your fragrant and delicious chicken biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or salad. Enjoy your homemade biryani!
