    Instructions:
    
    Preparing the Idly Batter:
    
    In a large bowl, wash and soak the parboiled rice and fenugreek seeds together. In a separate bowl, wash and soak the urad dal.
    Soak both the rice and urad dal separately for at least 4-6 hours, or overnight for best results.
    After soaking, drain the water from both the rice and urad dal.
    Grinding the Idly Batter:
    4. Using a wet grinder or a high-speed blender, grind the soaked urad dal into a smooth and fluffy batter. Add water as needed to achieve this consistency.
    
    Similarly, grind the soaked rice and fenugreek seeds into a smooth batter. The rice batter should be slightly coarse compared to the urad dal batter.
    Combine both batters in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.
    The batter should be thick but with a pouring consistency. Cover the bowl and let it ferment for 8-12 hours or overnight.
    Steaming the Idly:
    8. Before steaming, mix the fermented batter gently. If it's too thick, you can add a little water to achieve the right consistency.
    
    Grease the idly molds or plates with a little oil or use non-stick molds.
    Pour the batter into each mold, filling them about 3/4 full.
    In a steamer, add water and bring it to a boil.
    Place the idly molds in the steamer and cover it with a lid.
    Steam the idlies for 10-12 minutes on medium heat, or until a toothpick inserted into an idly comes out clean.
    Once done, remove the molds from the steamer and let them cool for a few minutes.
    Use a wet spoon to gently remove the idlies from the molds.
    Serving the Idly:
    16. Serve hot idlies with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, sambar, or any other favorite accompaniment.
    
    Enjoy your homemade soft and fluffy idlies!
    
    Note: The fermentation time may vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen. The batter should double in volume after fermenting, and it should have a slightly tangy flavor.
